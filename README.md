Recreate the game of Hangman with a theme

.markdown-preview.markdown-preview { p, ul, ol, {font-size: 1.2em;} }

This web page uses terms from the thoroughbred racing industry.

Once the game is loaded into your browser window, press any key to start the game.

All keys pressed after the first key are assumed to be letters that you are guessing are included in the word.

You are allowed to guess 10 wrong letters for a word before that game is terminated and a new game is started.

If you correctly guess a word, the Call To The Post will be played, and a dialog box confirming your correct guess will be displayed. A new game will be started after the dialog box is dismissed.

### Bugs

When you correctly guess a word, the last letter guessed will not be displayed on the screen. However, you will still receive credit for a win.
